I use github to manage the git repo. And there is an exporter to make ics files. So I wonder if I can use github's feature to generate ics files automatically? In this way, I can use the rawgithub file to serve as a subscription in my local icloud, instead of importing them manually periodically, to know if there's update.
For example, it generate 10 ics files, to serve as 10 kinds researching areas.

I'll help you set up an automated solution using GitHub Actions to generate ICS files that can be subscribed to via raw GitHub URLs. Let me first explore your current project structure to understand how your conference data is organized.

---

Read file: conferences.csv

---

Read file: fetch_conference_data.js

---

Read file: script.js

---

Let me also check the existing ICS export functionality and look at the source directory structure:

---

Read file: script.js

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory source • **11** results</summary>

| 📄 `080101.json` |
| 📄 `080102.json` |
| 📄 `080103.json` |
| 📄 `080104.json` |

| 📄 `080108.json` |
| 📄 `080109.json` |
| 📄 `080110.json` |
| 📄 `080101.js` |

</details>

Perfect! Now I understand your setup. You have 10 different research areas with conference data, and you already have ICS export functionality. Let me create a solution using GitHub Actions to automatically generate ICS files for each research area that can be subscribed to.

I'll create:
1. A GitHub Actions workflow that runs daily to generate ICS files
2. A Node.js script to generate separate ICS files for each research area
3. The ICS files will be committed to your repo and accessible via raw GitHub URLs

```diff
- 
+ name: Generate Conference ICS Files
+ 
+ on:
+   schedule:
+     # Run daily at 6:00 AM UTC (adjust timezone as needed)
+     - cron: '0 6 * * *'
+   workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering
+   push:
+     branches: [ main ]
+     paths: 
+       - 'fetch_conference_data.js'
+       - 'generate-ics.js'
+       - '.github/workflows/generate-ics.yml'
+ 
+ jobs:
+   generate-ics:
+     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+     
+     steps:
+     - name: Checkout repository
+       uses: actions/checkout@v4
+       
+     - name: Setup Node.js
+       uses: actions/setup-node@v4
+       with:
+         node-version: '18'
+         
+     - name: Fetch latest conference data
+       run: node fetch_conference_data.js
+       
+     - name: Generate ICS files
+       run: node generate-ics.js
+       
+     - name: Commit and push if changes
+       run: |
+         git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
+         git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
+         git add ics/
+         git add source/
+         if ! git diff --staged --quiet; then
+           git commit -m "🗓️ Auto-update conference ICS files - $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")"
+           git push
+         else
+           echo "No changes to commit"
+         fi 
```

Now let me create the ICS generation script that will create separate ICS files for each research area:
