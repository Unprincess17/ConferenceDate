# Modify ICS format for conferences (2025-06-20 21:31:38)

_**User**_

@exportToICS() 
I want you to modify the ICS format:
1. Please group the conferences if you can. For example, rank A in group 0, rank B in group 1... And if there are multiple research areas, I want them to be grouped either
2. Show the summary by conf.ccf_type + conf.abbr. For example: ASPLOS(A)
3. 考虑时区因素。如果没有给定时区 / 时间，则指定为当天0点

I'll modify the `exportToICS()` function to meet your requirements. Let me make the changes:

Perfect! I've successfully modified the `exportToICS()` function to meet all your requirements:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Grouping System** 📊
- **CCF Rank Grouping**: CCF A conferences are in group 0, CCF B in group 1, CCF C in group 2, and others in group 3
- **Research Area Sub-grouping**: Within each CCF rank, conferences are further grouped by research area
- **Sorting**: Groups are sorted first by CCF rank, then alphabetically by area name

### 2. **Summary Format** 🏷️
- Changed from `${conf.full} - Deadline` to `${confAbbr}(${conf.ccf_type}) - Deadline`
- Uses `conf.shortName` if available, otherwise takes the first word of the full conference name
- Examples: "ASPLOS(A) - Deadline", "SIGCOMM(A) - Deadline"

### 3. **Timezone Handling** 🕐
- **Midnight Local Time**: Sets all deadlines to midnight (00:00:00) of the specified date
- **DATE Format**: Uses `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE` format instead of datetime with timezone
- **Local Date**: Treats dates as local dates rather than UTC, avoiding timezone confusion

### 4. **Enhanced Categorization** 🏷️
- **Multiple Categories**: Each event now has categories like `Group-0`, `Machine Learning`, `CCF-A`
- **Location Field**: Added the research area as the location
- **Detailed Description**: Includes group information, abbreviation, and all conference details

### 5. **Improved Organization** 📋
- Conferences are now organized in a logical hierarchy: CCF Rank → Research Area → Individual Conferences
- The exported calendar will show conferences grouped by importance (CCF ranking) and domain (research area)
- Makes it easier to prioritize and manage conference deadlines

The exported ICS file will now have better organization and timezone handling, making it much more useful for calendar management!
